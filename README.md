# Data Analysis and Insights - Assignment

## Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and identifying key insights from a dataset related to tipping behavior. The assignment follows structured steps, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, to understand relationships between various features.

## Dataset
- **Name:** `tips.csv`
- **Description:** The dataset contains information about customer tipping behavior in restaurants. It includes attributes such as total bill, tip amount, gender, smoking status, day of the week, time of dining, and party size.
- **Format:** CSV file

## Tasks Performed
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Loaded the dataset.
- Handled missing values (if any).
- Removed duplicate records.
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Univariate Analysis
- Computed summary statistics (mean, median, variance, skewness, etc.).
- Visualized distributions using histograms and box plots.

#### Bivariate Analysis
- Created a correlation matrix heatmap.
- Used scatter plots to analyze relationships between numerical variables.
- Included box plots and violin plots to compare categorical vs. numerical features.

#### Multivariate Analysis
- Implemented pair plots to visualize relationships among multiple variables.
- Grouped comparisons to assess combined effects of features.

## Key Findings
- **Total bill and tip amount have a strong positive correlation.**
- **Gender and smoking status influence tipping behavior.**
- **Day and time do not significantly impact tipping trends.**
- **Grouping features improves prediction accuracy.**

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Place `tips.csv` in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open `DAI-Assignment_2_Khushal MIttal_23116044` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.
4. Review the visualizations and insights generated.
